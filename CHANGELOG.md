## Migration Guide: v1 ‚Üí v2

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install new dependencies
bun install
```

### Command Changes

```bash
# v1
./migrate-notion.js ./my-export

# v2 - Always test first!
./migrate-notion-optimized.js ./my-export --dry-run

# v2 - Run migration
./migrate-notion-optimized.js ./my-export
```

### New Capabilities

```bash
# Preview changes
./migrate-notion-optimized.js ./my-export --dry-run

# Fast mode (no backups)
./migrate-notion-optimized.js ./my-export --skip-backup

# Debug mode
./migrate-notion-optimized.js ./my-export --verbose

# Get help
./migrate-notion-optimized.js --help
```

### Benefits of Upgrading

1. **Safety**: Dry-run and backups prevent data loss
2. **Speed**: 2x faster for large exports
3. **Visibility**: Progress bars show exactly what's happening
4. **Recovery**: Automatic backups enable easy rollback
5. **Reliability**: Better error handling and reporting

### Compatibility

- Both versions produce identical output (frontmatter, links, etc.)
- v2 is backward compatible with v1 exports
- Can safely run v2 on directories previously processed by v1
